# hello-world
Just another repository 

Hey all,
Im a newbie and hoping to make coding a part-time hobby.
Have no experience with coding outside of one semester of highschool computer science so this will be a long journey haha!


##Goals to work on
I want to practice coding skills by emulating some games that I really ejoyed. Here is the order that I think would be the easiest to progress from:
1. Virtual pet
2. pixel dungeon
3. pokemon mystery dungeon
4. monster hunter
5. settlers of catan
